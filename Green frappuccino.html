<p > A Green Tea Cream Frappuccino is a blended beverage that starts with a base of finely ground green tea powder, known as matcha. This vibrant green powder is made from specially grown and processed green tea leaves, giving it a distinct flavor and a concentrated dose of antioxidants. When combined with milk, ice, and a creamy base, the matcha creates a smooth and frothy mixture that forms the heart of the Green Tea Cream Frappuccino.</center></p>
