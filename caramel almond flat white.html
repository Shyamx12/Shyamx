Pull two shots of espresso using the espresso machine. Steam the milk until it reaches a velvety texture. If using almond milk, ensure it's properly steamed to create a creamy consistency. Add caramel syrup and almond syrup (or almond extract) to the bottom of your coffee cup.Pour the steamed milk over the syrups, holding back the foam with a spoon. Gently pour the espresso shots over the milk and syrups, allowing the espresso to blend with the milk. Spoon a dollop of foam on top of the drink. Optionally, drizzle caramel syrup on top of the foam for extra flavor and decoration. Your Caramel Almond Flat White coffee is now ready to enjoy! Adjust the amount of syrup according to your taste preferences.
